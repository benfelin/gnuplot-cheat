Gnuplot is the AWK of plotting.

It uses it's own very domain specific language.

It can get specific jobs done with amazing golfing.

But if you get slightly away from its intended usage, it becomes insane or impossible to get the task done.

So only use it for quick and dirty applications, and pyplot for everything else.

Limitations: (TODO link to SO questions):

- cannot draw primitives like points or lines
- cannot draw vector flow plots from functions
- no C API, only via pipes... the usual GNU bullshit.
