# Introduction

*Not* related to the GNU project, and does not use GPL!! LOL.

It can be used freely, but you cannot distribute a modified version, only patches. Like CC no derivatives?

Ubuntu 14.04 install:

    sudo apt-get install gnuplot-x11

Most commands have a short form, e.g.:

    plot

has short form:

    p

I recommend using the long form when scripting, and the short form for interactive sessions.
